# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :

During my internship at CODTECH, I developed a dynamic web application that integrates and displays real-time weather information and current news headlines by consuming two different APIs: a weather data API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) and the NewsAPI. The aim of this project was to create a unified dashboard that provides users with live updates on weather conditions and breaking news in a visually organized and responsive format. The project involved frontend development, API integration, data parsing, and asynchronous JavaScript handling.

The first phase of development involved selecting appropriate APIs. For weather data, I used an API capable of returning various metrics including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, and weather condition codes. For news, I used NewsAPI, which aggregates real-time news headlines from reliable sources and offers filtering based on keywords, categories, language, and country.

After acquiring the necessary API keys, I created the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defined a clean layout with dedicated sections for live weather data, forecast summaries, and a dynamic news feed. CSS was used for styling components and ensuring a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

The functional logic was implemented using JavaScript, where I developed asynchronous functions to fetch and handle API data. The weather data was fetched using a GET request with parameters such as city name or geographic coordinates. The API returned a JSON response from which key weather parameters were extracted, including current temperature (in both Celsius and Fahrenheit), humidity levels, atmospheric pressure in hPa, wind speed and direction, visibility in meters, and a textual description of the weather condition. A corresponding icon was also displayed based on the weather status code for visual clarity.

For the news section, data was fetched by applying keyword filters like “tech,” “IPL,” or “breaking news.” The top headlines were extracted from the response JSON, including each article’s title, source name, summary description, thumbnail image, and a hyperlink to the full article. The results were dynamically inserted into the DOM using JavaScript, allowing for seamless real-time content updates based on user search or periodic refresh.

The application employed async/await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous operations. Data from both APIs was parsed and handled efficiently to avoid UI blocking and ensure fast load times. Error handling was also included to manage invalid API responses, missing data, or failed fetch attempts, displaying appropriate fallback messages to the user.

The final result was a functional, multi-section web application that presents real-time insights from two distinct data sources. The interface was designed for clarity and responsiveness, providing users with actionable information—such as the current weather in their city and trending news stories—in a single view. The modular structure of the code allows for future enhancements like geolocation-based weather detection, keyword search filters for news, or integration with additional APIs.
