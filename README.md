# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :

In this project, I developed a dynamic web application that integrates and displays real-time weather information and current news headlines by consuming two different APIs: a weather data API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) and the NewsAPI. The purpose of this project was to enhance user engagement by presenting timely and relevant information in a visually organized format. This task involved a combination of front-end development, asynchronous JavaScript programming, and efficient API data handling.

The primary task began with identifying the correct APIs that provide detailed and accurate data. For weather information, I used an API that supports multiple weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, and overall weather conditions like cloudy, sunny, or rainy. For news, I selected NewsAPI, which aggregates headlines from various reliable sources and allows filtering based on search terms, categories, countries, or language.

Once the APIs were selected and the necessary API keys were obtained, I moved on to setting up the project environment. The application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defined the layout of the web application, including sections for current weather, forecast summaries, and a news feed. CSS was used to style the components for a clean and user-friendly interface. Responsive design techniques ensured compatibility across various screen sizes.

The main functional logic was written in JavaScript. I created asynchronous functions using the async/await syntax to fetch data from both APIs. For the weather API, the function made a request using parameters such as city name or geographic coordinates. The response returned a JSON object, from which I extracted various weather parameters. I parsed the JSON data to retrieve specific fields like:

Temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit),

Humidity percentage,

Atmospheric pressure (in hPa),

Wind speed and direction,

Visibility (in meters),

Weather description with icons representing the current condition.

Similarly, for the News API, I fetched data by keyword, such as “ipl,” “tech,” or “Breaking news” and filtered results to show only the top articles. Each news item extracted included the headline, source, short description, thumbnail image, and a link to the full article. The data was then dynamically rendered to the DOM using JavaScript, ensuring that the displayed content refreshed or changed based on new user queries or API updates.

Overall, this project was a practical and enriching experience that reinforced my skills in web development, API integration, data parsing, and asynchronous JavaScript. It also demonstrated how to bring together different sources of information into a unified dashboard that delivers real-time insights to users in an intuitive and accessible manner.
